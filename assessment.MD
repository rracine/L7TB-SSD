# ASSESSMENT PLAN

## B2B (Business to Business) Strategic Sales Director (B2B) Masters (Level 7) Degree Apprenticeship

## Introduction
The objective of this apprenticeship is to develop B2B Strategic Sales Directors across all industry sectors. These Strategic Sales Directors will design, deploy, and change the selling system of their organisation and will manage the execution of the selling system by their B2B Sales Professionals (Level 6 Degree Apprenticeship) whilst demonstrating strong ethical practice.
It is an ‘integrated apprenticeship’ in that it has been designed to fully integrate a Higher Education Provider (HEP) validated masters degree that leads to workplace occupational competency as a Strategic Sales Director. It will typically take 2 calendar years to complete.

The assessment approach within the degree has been designed to ensure that apprentices meet the skills, knowledge and behaviour outcomes as defined in the Apprenticeship Standard, whichever HEP is delivering the programme. It has also been designed to be:
1. Flexible - appropriate, relevant and feasible for all apprentices/employers across a wide range of employment contexts
2. Consistent - Provide a consistent approach to the assessment of the knowledge, skills and behaviours required by the Apprenticeship Standard to provide employers with confidence of the equivalence of the standard achieved
3. Viable – an affordable and manageable approach to delivering ‘end-point assessment’ (EPA) based on the number of potential learners.

The achievement of the degree acts as a verification that the standard has been met by the apprentice and this will be assessed through a comprehensive EPA undertaken in the final stage of the degree. The EPA will be comprised of two components: a final Work Based Project assessment and a Panel Interview. The degree programme will also include a summative assessment at the end of years 1 and 2 which the apprentice must pass to progress.
HEPs meet the rigorous quality assurance standards that are set, monitored and upheld by the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA). They have robust and respected assessment processes and quality assurance that incorporates internal moderation and external examiners to ensure the independence of the assessment process across the degree.
This apprenticeship is distinguished by the blend of employer defined skills, knowledge and behaviour outcomes that are integrated and assessed as part of the degree with professional recognition by the Association of Professional Sales (APS) through certified status.
The remainder of this assessment plan will set out the approach to assessment, including what will be assessed, how it will be assessed and the role of HEPs, employers and apprentices in the assessment process.

## Assessment Overview
This is typically a three-calendar year apprenticeship with an integrated approach to the assessment of knowledge, skills and behaviours. Delivery and assessment are organised through a range of modules that deliver the HEP’s approach to the curriculum. The modules will cover the breadth and depth of the standard using on-programme assessment methods that integrate the knowledge, skills and behaviour components, and which ensure that the apprentice is sufficiently prepared to undertake the synoptic EPA.
Each HEP will develop and validate its own degree programme and will map the individual modules to the outcomes in the apprenticeship standard. Individual modules will include formative and summative assessment of the skills, knowledge and behaviour outcomes en-route to the final EPA. The apprentice will be required to develop a Learning Journal of evidence of their professional development and this will be also referenced as evidence during the Panel Interview component of the EPA. The Work Based Project is required to be a substantial piece of work undertaken within the final stage of the apprenticeship.
The blend of proposed on-programme formative and summative assessment leading to the EPA is shown in figure 1 below.

3. Assessment Methods
The assessment strategy includes on-programme formative and summative assessments for each programme module, end of year/stage summative assessments and an EPA.

On-programme formative assessment methods will include a Learning Journal showing evidence of reflection of learning, and a mix of action plans, presentations, reports, role-play, individual and group observation, customer and company assessment. These assessment methods will be applied to the modules proposed by each HEP to assess the development of knowledge, skills and behaviours required by the standard.
Formative assessment is a shared responsibility between the apprentices’ designated Coach and the HEP Tutor. The Coach will provide the industry context and feedback on the development of the apprentices’ professional competencies. The Tutor will review this and provide further formative feedback. All on-programme summative assessment is managed by the HEP and will be graded.
The forms of the end of year/stage summative assessments may vary but could include a work based project, a presentation, a report or an on-line assessment.
The integrated EPA will be comprised of a final Work Based Project and a Panel Interview.
4. Approaches to Apprenticeship Delivery
Each HEP will develop its own programme structure to develop the skills, knowledge and behaviours required of the apprenticeship standard and the assessment methods outlined in this plan.
On-programme delivery will:
 Be constructed to maximise the benefit from work-based and online learning
 Provide time for learners to study and reflect on their learning
 Deliver a clearly structured programme where achievements are built up and progress is transparent
 Reflect the way in which the skills and knowledge are used professionally in the role of a B2B Sales Professional, ensuring that knowledge and skills are developed and supported logically
This is a professional training programme so learning will typically take place away from a traditional lecture room environment via a blended learning approach which may be delivered through the following routes:
 Work based learning – on the job development and application of skills, knowledge and professional behaviours. Monitored through regular tutorials with HEP staff and supervised in the work place by the apprentice’s Coach
 Introductory (module) workshops – taught sessions by professional practitioners and specialist HEP staff introducing new relevant academic and professional content
 Specialist workshops – which may be delivered face-to face and/or online
 Contextualised work based projects - where skills, knowledge and behaviour can be applied in a professional working environment
 Peer and/or tutor-led workshops, professional network seminars, peer learning sets
 Virtual / online learning – this can include structured individual and/or group online learning activities and tasks that involves facilitated tutor and peer group feedback to support learning development. Online learning will also typically include access to a range of relevant learning materials.

On-programme learning will include the requirement to produce a ‘Learning Journal’, to help integrate the on-the job and off-the job learning. The Learning Journal is a collection of evidence that demonstrates the skills, knowledge and behaviours that the apprentice has acquired against the standard, how learning has been applied and their achievements and capabilities. It is also a mandatory component of the EPA and will help to confirm competence against the standard. There will be regular reviews between the Coach and the apprentice to review the Learning Journal and the apprentice’s progress.
Individual on-programme modules will be assessed and must be passed in accordance with HEP regulations. The HEP and employer will support the apprentice and provide extra guidance where performance issues might arise to ensure that the apprentice is fully supported in meeting the outcomes of the standard. The approach draws upon the established good practice already undertaken in HEPs, but with the advantage of employer support and the workplace context to help apprentices see the real-world application of their skills, knowledge and behaviours on an ongoing basis.
The HEP’s are responsible for ensuring that all assignments that contribute to module assessments are examined in a consistent way and that the judgments reached are comparable and reliable.
5. Formative Assessment
The formative module assessments assess the skills, and knowledge and behaviours as set out in the B2B Sales Professional standard and as detailed in Appendix 1. The degree modules will cover the full range of the required skills and knowledge from the standard. The modules will be developed against the standard to integrate appropriate blends of skill and knowledge. This will enable individual instances of degree apprenticeship programmes to be mapped against the standard.
The formative assessment will give an ongoing indication of performance against the final outcomes defined in the standard. The HEP and employer will be able to support the apprentice and provide extra guidance where performance issues might arise to ensure that the apprentice is fully supported in meeting the outcomes on the standard. This will provide regular review points to ensure guided progression.
This approach draws upon the established good practice already undertaken in universities, but with the advantage of employer support and the workplace context to help apprentices value the real world application of their skills, knowledge and behaviours on an ongoing basis.
6. End-Point Assessment
The end-point assessment is specifically designed to test the professional competence of the apprentice to undertake the B2B Sales Professional job role and the assessment approach will cover all the Knowledge, Skills and Behaviours defined in the standard.
The gateway to being able to take the integrated EPA is:
 Completion of all the programme modules
Reference: ST0423
5
 Successful completion of the module assessments
 Completion of the Learning Journal with ‘sign-off’ from the workplace Coach
 Achievement of English and Mathematics at level 2 if not achieved prior to the apprenticeship.
The integrated EPA will comprise of the following two components:
(i) A Final, Work Based Project
(ii) A Panel Interview
The combination of the final work based project and the panel interview will fully test that the apprentice meets all requirements of the standard.
6.1 Final Work Based Project.
This will be a contextualised work based project covering all the relevant activities of a B2B Sales Professional which will demonstrate enhancement of the apprentice’s professional practice. For example, a Customer case study, a development project leading to a Customer proposal, detailed development of a new customer’s account plan.
The Work Based Project will be assessed for evidence that the Knowledge, Skills and Behaviours required of a B2B Sales Professional are inherent in the apprentice’s sales practice and the content of the project must enable the following to be demonstrated:
 the approach to planning and completion of the project, including what has to be delivered on completion of the project.
 the application of the knowledge and skills to meet the outcomes in the standard
 the application of behaviours from the standard
 evidence of learning and reflection and of clear outcomes for the apprentice, their organisation and the customer
It will be developed over a period of 6 months in the final year of the programme
The HEPS will work with the employer and apprentice to agree a suitable project topic and title and support arrangements for the project to be undertaken. The apprentice will scope out what is required and present terms of reference and an initial plan for agreement by the employer, apprentice and HEP.
A typical structure for the Work Based Project may include:
 Objectives
 Business Context, covering both the employer and customer context including strategic aims, market insights and market trends
 Customer Requirements
 Solution Options
 Business Case(s)
 Sales Approach and Rationale
 Stakeholder Management
Reference: ST0423
6
 Sales Planning and use of a Sales Methodology
 Reflection on customer meetings and outcomes and group working
 Conclusion and Learning Outcomes
The apprentice will be required to document their assumptions and to highlight the consequences of those assumptions, enabling them to demonstrate their understanding of commercial pressures, and the application of their thinking and problem solving skills.
The apprentice will be requried to provide a signed statement to confirm it is his/her own work.
6.2 Panel Interview
This will be a 45-minute interview where the apprentice will present:
 a summary of their project, including their rationale for choosing their topic and any tangible outcomes
 reflections on their learning through the project
 culminating with a question and answer session
The initial focus for the panel interview is on the work presented in the project. However, the panel of assessors must also explore the apprentice’ broader experience from the workplace, to demonstrate that the skills and knowledge defined in the standard have been met. The Learning Journal is a mandatory component of the EPA and should be referenced during the Panel Interview as evidence of the apprentice’ professional competence and how they have developed as a Sales Professional.
The panel interview will either take place at the HEP or a venue mutually agreed to by the employer and the HEP. It is the responsibility of the HEP to liaise with the employer and to convene the EPA Panel Interview. The HEP will provide guidance on the nature of the panel interview and the assessment criteria used. This will ensure that consistent approaches are taken and that all key areas are appropriately explored.
Practical Requirements for the Panel Interview
 The apprentice should have appropriate notice of their interview time and have at least seven days’ notice
 A structured brief will be used to support the panel interview to ensure a consistent approach
 The presentation and Q&A will typically last 45 minutes – and no more than one hour
 The panel interview will be conducted face to face or in exceptional circumstances via live media
 The HEP must put the apprentice at ease and give the apprentice the opportunity to do his/her very best
 The panel interview is conducted by the full panel at the same time.
Only one opportunity will be given to re-take the EPA, thus it will be important that the apprentice evaluates both with their Coach and the assessing HEP their readiness to complete this final assessment. Feedback will be provided to apprentices particularly in relation to areas where performance has not yet meet the required standard.
6.3 EPA Assessors
Reference: ST0423
7
Since the EPA will act as the indicator of professional competence, the assessment will involve industry specialists and external professional assessors, independent of the HEP in the process.
There will be three assessors involved in the panel interview component of the EPA:
(i) a representative from the HEP (who will Chair the Panel)
(ii) an independent B2B Sales Professional
(iii) one other suitably qualified assessor who may be from the employer organisation or external to them.
The independent B2B Sales Professional will come from an independent organisation, recommended by The Professional Body (The APS) or a HEP and agreed with the employer. The industry practitioner will need to be a Senior Sales Professional in a B2B setting with a minimum of 5 years of direct line management and people leadership experience.
7. Apprenticeship Grading
The assessment decision for the EPA will be made collaboratively by the three panel assessors. In any circumstances where there are conflicting or boarder line decisions, the final decision maker will be the HEP representative as Chair.
The degree and apprenticeship will be graded using Honours degree classifications for English universities. All UK universities must follow the QAA (Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education) Code of practice for the assurance of academic quality and standards in higher education. This ensures continued consistency.

The completion of the integrated degree will signify the attainment of the apprenticeship and will be graded based on the assessment outcomes for years 2 and 3 (including the EPA). The year 2 assessment will contribute no more than 30% towards the overall degree classification (grade).
Note, that it is a compulsory requirement that all apprentices have a level 2 qualification in English and Mathematics in order to complete the apprenticeship. Whilst it is likely most candidates would have achieved this prior to undertaking the apprenticeship, apprentices without level 2 English and Mathematics qualifications on entry will need to achieve this prior to taking the EPA.
8. Quality Assurance
HEPs have extremely robust assessment processes and approaches that are approved by the QAA and ensure independence. The overall quality assurance across the degree programme’s, on-programme and EPA is achieved using independent external examiners. The system of external examining is a distinctive feature of Higher Education in the UK. All degree programmes delivered in Higher Education Institutions in the UK will have an external examiner.
Reference: ST0423
8
External examiners are appointed on the basis of their independence and relevant subject/practice expertise. They are suitably qualified to report and provide advice on the academic standards and quality of learning opportunities provided by the degrees (or other awards), to which they have been assigned. They independently assure quality through their following responsibilities:
 to evaluate all forms of assessment which contribute to apprentices’ award results
 to evaluate, and help ensure fairness and consistency in the assessment process
 to moderate summatively assessed work at module and programme level
 to comment on draft examination papers and assessment tasks as appropriate
 to report on the structure, content, academic standards and teaching of programmes.
They will review the programme, its modules, teaching materials, apprentice feedback and especially the assessment methods as well as samples of apprentice assessment work across modules. They ensure fair and consistent moderation and to confirm that marking standards are comparable with standards across UK Higher Education. If an external examiner is concerned about accuracy and consistency of marking within a sample of apprentice’s work, all work within that module may be re-marked.
External examiners are also members of module and programme assessment boards and report of the effectiveness of the operation of these boards and review and comments on the distribution of marks across modules and identify any issues or aspects of good practice. Recommendations from external examiners to address identified issues require a formal response from programme teams.
These duties are consistently undertaken in relation to the academic standards of HEPs, and will relate to internal and external reference points, including the Apprenticeship Standard and Assessment Plan for the B2B Sales Professional Apprenticeship.
There are also robust quality assurance procedures within modules. These include setting clear assessment and grading criteria for apprentices, initial assessment and moderation processes. Following initial assessment, moderators will:
 appraise the set module assessments to ensure they are appropriate
 review the assessment marking
 undertake sample marking against the assessment criteria
9. Consistent and Reliable Judgements
The process of initial assessment, moderation and External Examiner review is designed to ensure consistency of assessment. This practice is consistent with the QAA Code of Practice for UK HE (QAA UK Quality Code, Chapter A1 and B6).
In addition External Examiners have a specific role to ensure that all assessments are consistent and comparable nationally. As above, this is in line with the QAA Code of Practice.
10. External Quality Assurance
The QAA will provide external quality assurance.

11. Affordability
The costs for the on-programme aspect of the apprenticeship training, the degree EPA and any associated online support and external professional assessors will be bundled up into one apprenticeship cost for the employer. The awarding provider will define these costs as they are likely to vary as industry practice varies, but the cost of the end-point assessment component will remain constant at between 15%-20% of the total cost.
12. Anticipated Volumes
Anticpated volumes of starts from the trailblazer group members for 2017 number 70 and are forecast at 120+ for 2018. The APS have also started to gather predicted volumes and currently 21 organisations have forecast an average of 10 starts each leading to a further 210 starts.
The consultation delivered wide support and interest from other B2B Sales organisations and we expect the trailblazer volume totals to be matched by these and other organsiations.
13. Implementation
HEPS are extremely capable in delivering synoptic and robust assessment approaches that represent the application of an apprentice’s skills, knowledge and professional behaviours and the approach presented offers an affordable and scalable solution to assessment for this apprenticeship.
