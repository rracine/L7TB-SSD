## What is the difference between a Master of Science (MSc) and a Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree ?
The **Master of Business Administration (MBA)** degree is an executive-level business course designed for people with executive or management level experience. MBA degrees are designed to develop leadership skills and offer professionals the opportunity to formally recognise their business expertise. A prerequisite for studying an MBA is that candidates must have work experience, usually a minimum of three years at a strategic level. This creates a rich learning environment as participants come from a range of industries and bring their different experiences into the course. It is important for participants to have practical experience as MBA programmes require students to think strategically and use work place evidence within assessments. Traditional MBAs offer a broad grounding in a variety of business disciplines but there is also a range of specialist MBAs where students can major in an area of interest: management, marketing, finance, sales or HR.
